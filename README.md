## RCT-without-detection
This repository contains programs to reconstruct the 3-D molecular structure from micrographs collected in the random conical tilt scheme in cryo-electron microscopy. The approach circumvents the need for particle picking, and thus show promise to reduce the size limit for single particle reconstruction in cryo-electron microscopy. 

The codes are written in Python, and requires the following libraries to run:
*mrcfile*, *pyCUDA*, *scikit-cuda*, *FINUFFT*, *TensorFlow*

For details of the method, see
